/**
 * {@link ISVNAdminAreaFactorySelector} that uses 1.4 compatible workspace for new check out,
 * but still supports 1.5 workspace, if asked to work with it.
 *
 * <p>
 * Since there are many tools out there that still don't support Subversion 1.5 (including
 * all the major Unix distributions that haven't bundled Subversion 1.5), using 1.4 as the
 * default would reduce the likelihood of the user running into "this SVN client can't work
 * with this workspace version..." problem when using other SVN tools.
 *
 * <p>
 * The primary scenario of this is the use of command-line SVN client, either from shell
 * script, Ant, or Maven.
 *
 * <p>
 * Working copy changes from Subversion 1.6 to 1.7 was so big that they introduced a separate
 * {@link SvnWcGeneration} constant to represent that. So this class alone is no longer sufficient
 * to make SVNKit sticks to the version we want it to use. See {@link SvnClientManager} that
 * controls the other half of this.
