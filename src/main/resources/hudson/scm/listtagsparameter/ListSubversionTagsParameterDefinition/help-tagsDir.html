<div>
  Specify the Subversion repository URL which contains the tags to be listed
  when triggering a new build.

  <p>
  You can also specify the root of a Subversion repository: If this root contains
  the <code>trunk</code>, <code>branches</code> and <code>tags</code> folders,
  then the dropdown will display <code>trunk</code>, all the branches and all the
  tags. If the root does not contain these three folders, then all its subfolders
  are listed in the dropdown.

  <p>
  When you enter the URL, Jenkins automatically checks if it can connect to it.
  If access requires authentication, you'll be prompted for the necessary
  credential. If you already have a working credential but would like to change
  it for some other reasons, you can <a href="{0}/credentials" target="_blank"
  >manage credentials</a> and specify a different credential.
