    Disables the generation of SVN changelogs.<p/>
    
    Sometimes the SVN checkout and changelog generation procedures take much time 
    due to the big number of <b>svn:external</b> dependencies.
    This option can be used to temporarily disable the calculation of changelogs
    in such case (e.g. for the job development purposes).
