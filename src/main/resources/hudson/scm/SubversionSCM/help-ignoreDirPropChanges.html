<div>
  If set, Jenkins ignores changes that consist of modifications of directories (which are svn-property changes).
  These changes are ignored when determing whether a build should be triggered and they are removed from a running
  build's changeset (so these changes do not lead to a rebuild of a module in an incremental maven build).
  Main usage of this property is to ignore svn:mergeinfo changes (which would otherwise lead to a complete rebuild
  of a maven project, in spite of incremental build option).
